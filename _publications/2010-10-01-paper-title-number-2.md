collection: patents
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'The invention relates to a global vehicle track construction method under incomplete sensing data, which comprises the following steps: constructing a vehicle cross-domain track extraction model, and tracking and extracting vehicle tracks under multiple cameras by combining vehicle running traffic characteristics; performing primary camera space coordinate conversion by using camera calibration, and smoothing vehicle track data acquired by a radar; extracting space-time characteristics from vehicle track data, constructing a space-time synchronous optimization model according to the space-time characteristics, unifying the space-time coordinates of the multiple sensors, and fusing camera data and radar data; and establishing a track completion evaluation index, fusing the space-time interaction characteristics of the vehicle track, constructing a vehicle track completion model, and performing completion repair on the missing track. Compared with the prior art, the method has the advantages that the multi-sensor data are fused to complement the advantages, the space-time characteristics of the vehicle track are considered, and the integrity and the reliability of the vehicle track can be effectively improved by the provided track complementing method.'
