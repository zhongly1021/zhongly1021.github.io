I'm a second-year master's student from [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

My research interest include Shared Mobility, Intelligent Transportation Systems, etc. My keen interest lies in the multi-agent optimization within traffic systems, which encompasses the collaborative control and optimization of transportation systems, the communication and sharing of information, and the intricate interactions among intelligent agents. This focus is crucial for enhancing traffic efficiency, ensuring equitable access to transportation resources, and promoting environmentally sustainable practices.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Neda Masoud](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/masoud-neda/) of Next Generation Mobility Systems Lab from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor to conduct the Independent Study. I got my bachelor's degree from Tongji Univerisity in June 2023, I was advised by Prof. Meiting Tu from the Department of Transportation Engineering, Tongji University. During my third year of undergraduate studies, I received guidance from Prof. Yuchuan Du and Associate Prof. Cong Zhao in the [STEP Lab](https://steps.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm), and won the first prize in the National Transportation Science and Technology Competition.
